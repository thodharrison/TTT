Current Personal project I am working on. This involves algorithms competing against against each other in tic tac toe.

If run with:

python TTT.py 

*It will play 50 games of rand vs rand (random moves)
*It will play 50 games of minimax vs rand (random moves)

Current goal is to implement a Q learning algorithm and have it play against varying depths of minimax.
